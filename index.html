        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>This app allows school administrators in the developing world to track and broadcast the needs of their school to board members in the US. </p> 
        <p>Once the board members in the US have the requests they can take care of them and mark them as done and/or scheduled.</p>

        <h2>Who is GMAD?</h2>
        <p>Cory and Stacey Hofman first traveled to Ghana in May of 2012, seeing that so many children were lacking many basic necessities in life, they were determined to help. Upon returning home, the Hofmans joined with others in Idaho to create Ghana Make a Difference (GMAD). </p> 
        <p> GMAD was founded in July 2012 to protect vulnerable children and to preserve families in Ghana. We also have a sister organization in Ghana, also called Ghana Make A Difference, that is a legally incorporated Ghana charitable organization.</p>
